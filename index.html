          <h1>Woman challenges MTA board: Ride the subway in a wheelchair</h1>

          <p>
            Mary Kaessinger has what a lot of New Yorkers wish they had: A subway stop just one block from her apartment.
          </p>

          <p>
            But there's a problem. Kaessinger can't use that stop.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I can't take it," she said. "There's no elevator."
          </p>

          <p>
            A retired IT worker, Kaessinger rides a motorized scooter, which means she can only use subway stations with elevators. That rules out more than 70 percent of New York's 422 subway stations, including all the stops in her neighborhood of Ditmas Park, Brooklyn.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kaessinger, 72, wanted the board members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to understand how difficult it is to use the transit system as a disabled person.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I want to issue you a challenge," she said to board members at their December meeting, held at the MTA's headquarters in the Financial District. "I challenge you to rent or buy a wheelchair and use it for a week."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Keep track of the time it takes you to find the elevators," she said, "and how long it takes you to figure out how to get in and out of the station."
          </p>

          <p>
            Kaessinger, one of several disability activists who spoke at the MTA board meeting, said it takes her twice as long as an able-bodied person to get anywhere in New York. Her roommate, who does not have a disability, can get from their house in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, to Penn Station in one hour. For Kaessinger, it takes two hours, because she has to ride a bus for 30 minutes to the nearest accessible station.
          </p>

          <p>
            But Kaessinger's main concern with the subway system, she said, is safety. Boarding the subway in a wheelchair or scooter is unsafe, she said, noting that most platforms have a gap that the wheels of her scooter get stuck on.
          </p>

          <p>
            "People have to lift me up and put me on the train," she said. "Invariably a complete stranger has to come help me."
          </p>

          <p>
            Then there was what happened last week. In the struggle to get onto the train, Kaessinger said, her foot slipped into the gap between the train and the platform. It was stuck, she said, until "a quick-thinking person" pulled it free.
          </p>

          <p>
            Public comments were limited to two minutes at the board meeting, and Kaessinger was prompted to conclude her remarks.
          </p>

          <p>
            "The solution is in your backyard," she told board members. The MTA should follow the lead of public transit in New Jersey. There, when a train conductor sees a person in a scooter or wheelchair, they bring a removable ramp that fits between the doors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, she said, it's a simple ride up the ramp, "and I'm on the train."
